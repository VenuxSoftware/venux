    services, or tools. Licensor also reserves the right to cancel unconfirmed accounts or accounts that have been inactive for a long time, or to modify or
    discontinue the System.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    <strong> 14. <u>Legal Disputes</u>. </strong>
    Licensee agrees that any claim or dispute at law or equity that has arisen or may arise between Licensee and Licensor will be resolved in accordance with
    the provisions set forth in this Legal Disputes Section.<strong> </strong>Please read this Section carefully. It affects Licensee's rights and will have a
    substantial impact on how claims the Licensee and Licensor have against each other are resolved.<strong> </strong>
</p>
<p>
    (a). <u>Applicable Law</u>.<strong> </strong>Licensee agrees that the laws of the State of New York, without regard to principles of conflict of laws, will
    govern this Agreement and any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between Licensee and the Licensor, except as otherwise stated in this
    Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    (b). <u> Agreement to Arbitrate</u>. Licensee agrees that any and all disputes or claims that have arisen or may arise between Licensee and the Licensor
    shall be resolved exclusively through final and binding arbitration, rather than in court, except that Licensee may assert claims in small claims court, if
    Licensee's claims qualify. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Agreement to Arbitrate.
</p>
<p>
    <u>(c). Prohibition of Class and Representative Actions and Non-Individualized Relief. </u>
</p>
<p>
    LICENSEE AGREES THAT BOTH LICENSEE AND LICENSOR MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY ON AN INDIVIDUAL BASIS AND NOT AS PART OF ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR
    REPRESENTATIVE ACTION OR PROCEEDING. UNLESS BOTH LICENSEE AND LICENSOR AGREE OTHERWISE, THE ARBITRATOR MAY NOT CONSOLIDATE OR JOIN MORE THAN ONE PERSON'S
    OR PARTY'S CLAIMS, AND MAY NOT OTHERWISE PRESIDE OVER ANY FORM OF A CONSOLIDATED, REPRESENTATIVE, OR CLASS PROCEEDING. ALSO, THE ARBITRATOR MAY AWARD
    RELIEF (INCLUDING MONETARY, INJUNCTIVE, AND DECLARATORY RELIEF) ONLY IN FAVOR OF THE INDIVIDUAL PARTY SEEKING RELIEF AND ONLY TO THE EXTENT NECESSARY TO
    PROVIDE RELIEF NECESSITATED BY THAT PARTY'S INDIVIDUAL CLAIM(S). ANY RELIEF AWARDED CANNOT AFFECT OTHER SYSTEM USERS.
</p>
<p>
    <u>(d). Arbitration Procedures.</u>
</p>
<p>
    Arbitration is more informal than a lawsuit in court. Arbitration uses a neutral arbitrator instead of a judge or jury, and court review of an arbitration
    award is very limited. However, an arbitrator can award the same damages and relief on an individual basis that a court can award to an individual. An
    arbitrator also must follow the terms of this Agreement as a court would.
</p>
<p>
    The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association ("AAA") under its rules and procedures, including the AAA's Supplementary
Procedures for Consumer-Related Disputes (as applicable), as modified by this Agreement to Arbitrate. The AAA's rules are available at<u><a href="http://www.adr.org/">www.adr.org</a></u>. A form for initiating arbitration proceedings is available on the AAA's website at <a href="http://www.adr.org.%20/"> http://www.adr.org.</a>
</p>
<p>
    The arbitration shall be held in the county in which Licensor is incorporated. If the value of the relief sought is $10,000 or less, Licensee and Licensor
    may elect to have the arbitration conducted by telephone or based solely on written submissions, which election shall be binding on Licensee and Licensor
    subject to the arbitrator's discretion to require an in-person hearing, if the circumstances warrant. Attendance at an in-person hearing may be made by
    telephone by Licensee and Licensor, unless the arbitrator requires otherwise.
</p>
<p>
    The arbitrator will decide the substance of all claims in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, including recognized principles of equity, and
    will honor all claims of privilege recognized by law. The arbitrator shall not be bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving different Licensees, but
    is bound by rulings in prior arbitrations involving the same Licensee to the extent required by applicable law. The arbitrator's award shall be final and
    binding and judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof.
</p>
<p>
    (e). <u>Costs of Arbitration.</u>
</p>
<p>
    Payment of all filing, administration and arbitrator fees will be governed by the AAA's rules, unless otherwise stated in this Agreement to Arbitrate. In
    the event the arbitrator determines the claim(s) Licensee asserts in the arbitration to be frivolous, Licensee agrees to reimburse Licensor for all fees
    associated with the arbitration.
</p>
<p>
    <u>(f). Judicial Forum for Legal Disputes.</u>
</p>
<p>
    Unless Licensee and Licensor agree otherwise, in the event that the Agreement to Arbitrate above is found not to apply to Licensee or to a particular claim
    or dispute, as a result of a court order, Licensee agrees that any claim or dispute that has arisen or may arise between Licensee and Licensor must be
    resolved exclusively by a state or federal court located in New York County, New York. Licensee and Licensor agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction
    of the courts located within New York County, New York for the purpose of litigating all such claims or disputes.
</p>
<p>
    <strong> 15. <u>General</u>.</strong>
</p>
<p>
    (a) This is a license and subscription agreement only, and nothing herein shall be construed as conveying to the Licensee title to the System. The System
    is and shall at all times remain the personal property of Licensor. Licensee agrees that it will never represent that the title to the System is in anyone
    other than Licensor and shall never cooperate, whether actively or passively, with anyone claiming any right, title or interest in the System, other than
    Licensor.
</p>
<p>
    (b) If any provision of this Agreement is unenforceable, such unenforceability shall not make any other provision hereof unenforceable. Any reference to
    any party includes its agents and employees. If any provisions of this Agreement conflict with any statute or rule or law in any jurisdiction wherein it
    may be sought to be enforced, then said provisions shall be deemed null and void to such extent, but without invalidating the remaining provisions.
</p>
<p>
    (c) The remedies of this Agreement provided in favor of Licensor shall not be deemed exclusive, but shall be cumulative, and shall be in addition to all
    other remedies in its favor existing at law or in equity. The failure or delay of Licensor in exercising any right granted it hereunder upon any occurrence
    of any of the contingencies set forth herein shall not constitute a waiver of any such right upon the continuation or recurrence of any such contingencies
    or similar contingencies and any single or partial exercise of any particular right by Licensor shall not exhaust the same or constitute a waiver of any
    other right provided herein.
</p>
<p>
    (d) Any failure by Licensor to require strict performance by Licensee of any term, covenants or agreements herein shall not be construed as a consent or
    waiver of any breach of the same or of any other term, covenant or agreement herein.
</p>
<p>
    (e) This Agreement constitutes the complete agreement and understanding among the parties, and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous proposals, oral or
    written, understandings, covenants, agreements, arrangements and communications between them relating to the subject matter of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    (f) Licensee acknowledges that it has had full opportunity to review this Agreement in detail and to seek independent legal representation and advice
    pertaining to this Agreement and either has done or has in its own independent business judgment chosen not to do so.
</p>
<p>
    (g) This Agreement shall not be construed against either party as the drafter of this Agreement.
</p>
<p>
    (h) All notices given by you or required under this Agreement shall be in writing and addressed to Licensor at <u>info@venux.com</u>.
</p>
<p>
    (i) Any attempts to circumvent and/or modify any provision of this Agreement without express consent from all the parties to this Agreement are null and
    void.
</p>
<p>
    In order to set up your account and to be allowed access to the System, you will be required to accept all of the above terms and conditions. If you do not
    accept this Agreement, follow the return instructions given to you online.
</p>
<p>
    IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have executed this License and Subscription Agreement by their duly authorized representatives.
