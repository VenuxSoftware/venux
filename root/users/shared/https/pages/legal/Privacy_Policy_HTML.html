    the changes.

        <strong><u>What Venux collects</u></strong>
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Venux does NOT collect any of your personal information.</u>
        Venux merely stores a copy of your encrypted data without being able to access your encrypted data itself.

    <p>
        Venux offers its clients the ultimate privacy. Just as Venux does not have access to the data you store, propagate, or encrypt using Venux services and
    products, Venux does not have access to your personal information (i.e., login user id and/or password). If you misplace or forget your login user id
    and/or password, you are out of luck - you are locked out from your Venux account and from the data you stored with Venux. Venux cannot help you. Why?
    Because, as noted above, Venux does NOT have access to your personal information! Therefore, Venux cannot recover it for you. You will have to start from
    scratch! Accordingly, Venux encourages you to keep your personal information safe. To update your personal information and communication preferences, you
can do so by accessing your profile on the Venux website <a href="http://www.venux.com/">www.venux.com</a> or by contacting Venux at    <a href="mailto:info@venux.com">info@venux.com</a>. Please note that:
