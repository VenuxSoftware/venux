        <h3>9. PROPRIETARY RIGHTS</h3>
        <p>(a) Software.</p>

        <p>(b) Content.</p>
        <p>The Services contain information, software, photos, video, graphics, sound, music, and other material ("Content") that are protected by copyright, 	trademark, trade secret, and other intellectual property law and that the rights in such Content are valid and protected in all forms, media, and 	technologies that now exist or that may be developed in the future. You may not modify, publish, distribute, transmit, transfer or sell, create derivative 	works, or in any way exploit any of the Content, in whole or in part. If no specific restrictions are displayed, you may make copies of portions of the 	Content, including material protected by copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights, provided the copies are made for your personal use and that you 	maintain any copyright, trademark, or other proprietary rights notices on the copies of the Content. Except as stated immediately above or as permitted by 	the fair use provision of U.S. copyright law, you may not upload, post, reproduce, or distribute any Content protected by copyright or other proprietary 	rights without the permission of the copyright owner.</p>
        <p>(c) Third-Party Content and Services.</p>
        <p>(1) If Venux offers the upload capability, you may only upload or otherwise distribute via the Services Content that is not subject to any copyright or 	other proprietary rights protection or for which you have the owner's express authorization for such online distribution. The unauthorized uploading or 	distribution of copyrighted or other proprietary Content constitutes a breach of this Agreement, and could subject you to criminal prosecution, personal 	liability for any damages arising from any infringement, and to termination of this Agreement. By uploading Content to the Services in any area that is 	generally accessible to other users, you automatically grant or warrant that the owner of the Content has expressly granted Venux the royalty-free, 	perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive right and license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, distribute, and transmit the Content, in whole 	or in part, worldwide and/or to incorporate it in other works in any form, media, or technology, now known or that may be developed in the future, for the 	full term of any copyright, including renewals, that may exist in such content. You also grant or warrant that the owner of the Content grants to other 	users the right and license to access, view, store, or reproduce the Content for that user's personal use. Subject to the above, the owner of the Content 	uploaded or distributed on the Services retains all rights that may exist in such Content.</p>
        <p>(2) Venux is a propagator and safe-keeper of the Content and not a publisher of Content supplied by third parties and users. Accordingly, Venux has no more 	editorial control over such Content than does a public library, bookstore, or newsstand. Any opinions, advice, statements, services, offers, or other 	Content expressed or made available by third parties are those of the respective authors, owners, or distributors and not of Venux. In no event will Venux 	be liable for any loss or damage caused by a user's reliance on Content obtained through the Services. It is your responsibility to evaluate the accuracy, 	completeness, or usefulness of any information, advice, opinion, or any other Content available through the Services.</p>
        <p>(3) The Services may permit you to receive information and order and receive merchandise and services directly from businesses that are not owned or 	operated by Venux. The purchase, payment, warranty, delivery, and any other terms concerning such information, merchandise, and services are solely between 	you and such businesses.</p>
        <p>(d) Export.</p>
        <p>The U.S. export control laws regulate the export and re-export of technology originating in the United States, including the electronic transmission of 	information and software to foreign countries and foreign nationals. You agree to comply with these laws and not to transfer by electronic transmission or 	otherwise, any Content derived from the Services without obtaining any required government authorization. You further agree not to upload to the Services 	any data or software that cannot be exported without prior written government authorization, including without limitation, certain types of encryption 	software.</p>

        <p>(a) For Any Reason.</p>
        <p>Either you or Venux may terminate this Agreement for any reason at any time by giving the other party notice of termination. Such termination shall be 	effective upon receipt of notice.</p>
        <p>(b) For Cause.</p>
        <p>Venux may terminate this Agreement without notice for any conduct that Venux believes in its sole discretion violates this Agreement, interferes with other 	users' use of the Services, or is otherwise inappropriate.</p>
        <p>(c) Effect of Termination.</p>
        <p>Upon termination, your license to use the Software automatically terminates, and Venux will delete all data, files, or other information stored in your 	account. In the event of termination, you remain bound by Sections 4, 5, 10(b), 11, and 13 of this Agreement.</p>
