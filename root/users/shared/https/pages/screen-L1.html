            <h2>About Venux</h2>
            <p>
                Venux is a cybernetics P2P software development company that aims to simplify the experience of computer and mobile device users. Our goal is to help you manage and secure your personal data. We want you to be able to communicate with friends, family, and co-workers in a private environment. Venux takes a new approach to digital privacy using the H.I.P.S.<sup>TM</sup> principle to keep your data fully secure from unwanted surveillance. We love to innovate and use the latest standards in technology.

            <p>Modern computing went through multiple phases over the past 50 years, each of which advanced computing and accompanying mathematical and  programming solutions that couldn't been foreseen by early pioneers. New  functionality was added constantly and system engineers had to implement them  quickly and reliably (at the moment of implementation). As time went on, there  was an apparent need for standards that implementers could rely on in order for  systems to be more interoperable and actually functioning.</p>

            <p>Yet, the market didn't want to wait for standards to mature  forcing technology producing companies to propose solutions that work, again,  at the time of implementation. Looking at the pan-cake, modern system design  vs. open standards developed over substantial period of time, it became very  clear that functionality required today can be done using standards at fraction  of cost of processing speed, memory used, interoperability/cross-platform  ability and simplicity preserved and all the other benefits.</p>
            <p>This is what Venux is all about. The Venux is "simplicity"  oriented Operating Platform designed to meet demands for 21st century computing.  The system is designed to be simple, secure, standards compliant, cross  platform as well as platform independent.</p>
            <h2>Complex Systems</h2>
            <p>
                "Complexity is generally used to characterize something with  many parts where those parts interact with each other in multiple ways. The  study of these complex linkages is the main goal of complex systems theory <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems_theory" target="_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_systems_theory</a>"
            </p>
            <p>To evolve and improve, a complex system must grow in size to  cover new functionality, in turn, using more resources and processing, rendering  ever advancing computer power back to 0. This phenomenon can be observed by  measuring 20 years old machine (such as Pentium 1) with Windows 95 and modern  i7 with Windows 8. User's perception of loading the system, open the program or  go to the Internet is still takes approximately the same amount of time even  though hardware speed and processing capacity improved exponentially.</p>
            <h2>Simple Systems</h2>
            <p>Simple system tends to have strict design with fever parts,  even after improvements. The Venux platform is designed towards simplicity  taking into account all of the complexity of modern tasks, processes, problems  and user's needs.</p>
